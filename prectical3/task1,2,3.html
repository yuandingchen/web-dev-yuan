<h3>What way of including internal links into the HTML page you would consider generally 
    preferable: absolute or relative links? Describe use cases for choosing absolute links and choosing relative links.</h3>
<h4>Preference is given to relative links</h4>
<p><em>Flexibility</em>: Relative links adapt to changes in page structure and are not affected by domain name or protocol changes.</p>
<p><em>Simplicity</em>: Relative links are generally shorter than absolute links, making the code easier to read and maintain.</p>
<h4>Use cases for relative links</h4>
<ul><li>Links to other pages within the same website.</li>
<li>Links need to be adapted to different environments (development, testing, production).</li></ul>
<h4>Use cases for absolute links:</h4>
<ul><li>Links to pages or resources on other websites.</li>
<li>Need to ensure that the link is not affected by relative path changes.</li></ul>
<h3>Research and write about image formats used in web-development. What is the 
    difference between JPG, GIF and PNG formats? What is WEBP image type? What is SVG?</h3>
<p><strong>JPG (JPEG):</strong>
Lossy compression: Part of the image information is lost during the compression process, so the file size is smaller.</p>
<p><strong>PNG:</strong>
Lossless compression: Larger file size without loss of image quality.</p>
<p><strong>GIF:</strong>
Lossless compression: suitable for simple images or animation effects.</p>
<p><strong>WEBP:</strong>
A new image format developed by Google.
At the same resolution, the size is more than 25% smaller than JPG and PNG.
Supports lossy and lossless compression, suitable for still images and animations</p>
<p><strong>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):</strong>
Vector graphics format that uses XML to describe images.
It can be enlarged without distortion and is suitable for drawing corporate logos, icons, etc.
Unlike images, SVG is text-based and can be easily modified.</p>
